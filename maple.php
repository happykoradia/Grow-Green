    <h2>Japanese Maple</h2>
    <p>Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum) is chosen for bonsai primarily due to its lobed leaves, color, and its adaptability to become
	a bonsai. Also, there are countless varieties and the bonsai tree can be formed in a variety of styles.</p>
	<p>Position: The Japanese Maple prefers a sunny, airy position but during great midday heat it should be placed in the light shade to prevent damaged leaves. The Japanese Maple is frost hardy 
	even when trained as a bonsai, but it should be protected from strong frost (below -10째 C / 14째 F).</p>
